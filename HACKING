Some rules for hacking on Ratat√∂skr
===================================

All in all, there are not many rules, Cowboy Coding FTW!

But here are some rules / advice, to make cooperation easier:

* Use the "develop" branch in git, not the "master" branch. The master branch
  should by now only contain releases (including beta versions). But for the
  work between releases, please use the develop branch from now on.
* More an advice than a rule: When implementing a particular feature, make a new
  branch for that feature. This should make things more clear for other people
  that merge your changes.
