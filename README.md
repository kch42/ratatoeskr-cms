Ratatöskr
=========

Ratatöskr is a flexible Content Management System / Blogging Software for PHP 5.3.

Why you should use Ratatöskr
----------------------------

* You want to modify the appearance of your Website fairly easily.
* You want to publish your content in multiple languages.
* You want to write powerful plugins using a simple API.

Possible reasons against Ratatöskr
----------------------------------

* Early development. So probably a lot of bugs.
* It will probably perform badly on websites with a lot of page hits (many SQL queries per page request).
* You do not want to write your own templates. Because templates define a lot of the page's behaviour, pre-build templates will probably not meet your needs. Ratatöskr focusses on individual page designs.
* You have a large team that manages the website. Ratatöskr has multi-user support, but there are no access control lists or something like that.

Wish List
---------

* Better multi-user support (e.g. access control lists)
* Version management of articles.

What does "Ratatöskr" mean?
---------------------------

> In Norse mythology, Ratatoskr \[*also spelled* **Ratatöskr**\] is a squirrel who runs up and down the world tree Yggdrasil to carry messages between the unnamed eagle, perched atop Yggdrasil, and the wyrm Níðhöggr, who dwells beneath one of the three roots of the tree.

Because Ratatöskr delivers messages, I thought it was a good name for a CMS / Blog-Software, which also delivers messages / news. Plus squirrels are cool animals :-).
